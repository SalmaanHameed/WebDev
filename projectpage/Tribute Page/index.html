    <p>Richard Feynman was a Nobel Prize-winning American physicist, particularly known for his contributions to quantum physics, quantum electrodynamics and particle physics, as well as quantum computing and nanotechnology. During his lifetime, he was one of the best-known scientists in the world, and was a great popularizer of physics through his books and lectures.He used to play the bongos at clubs and drink heavily.He was also regarded as something of an eccentric and free spirit. </p>
